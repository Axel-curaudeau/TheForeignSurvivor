# Upgrade

Since the presentation given to the teachers, we add some features:
- Annoucement of power ups
- Pause menu
- Heart collectible giving life points looted from enemies (1% chance of drop, 1 heart = 20 life point)
- Show the number of enemies still alive

# Non developed features:

As we never developed games before, every feature take a lot of time to develop. As the teacher advised us, we decided to focus on the core of the game, and to have a working game.

## Objectives:

We think that a good survivor game commes with a lot of different enemies, and a lot of different weapons.

We wanted to add a weapon catalog, giving the objective to the player to find all the weapons.

Kill a minimum of enemies with each weapon will unlocked a descritpion of it, like the damage and durability or other effect.
